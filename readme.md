Photo Blog

This is a photo blog to post family photographs.

I intend to have a database of posts, which will be simple, one-image posts with titles and captions.

The database will then have a table that organizes posts into groups (i.e. slideshows, galleries, etc.) to organize things.

Then there will be a front end that displays all of this.
